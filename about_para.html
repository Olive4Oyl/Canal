           <p class="about_p">The Canal sports bar was established 15 years ago in spring 2001. Three friends, Wilson, Leidecker, and Simoy, came together to make their dreams into reality. Wilson always wanted to own his own business and Leidecker chose this particular area in Brooklyn. Then there was Simoy, who decided to run the place. The bar has been a success and is a main event in the Gowanus area. They are infamously known for their signature drink, The Superfund. The bar's motto is to have super fun with a superfund in the heart of Gowanus. Also, Canal serves refreshments and meals for patrons to nibble on while watching a sport on TV.</p>
